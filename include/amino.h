 *
 * \mainpage
 *
 * Amino is package of basic utilites for robotics software.  It
 * includes mathematical and linear algebra routines, memory
 * management, and time-handling.  Design goals are easy integration,
 * efficiency, and simplicity.
 *
 * \section mem Memory Allocation
 *
 * Amino provides two O(1), non-fragmenting allocators.  The region
 * allocator performs variable-sized allocation and frees all objects
 * with a single call.  The pooled allocator allocates and frees
 * fixed-sized blocks. \sa amino/mem.h
 *
 * \section la Linear Algebra
 *
 * Amino provides some light-weight wrappers over BLAS and LAPACK plus
 * a few other convenience routines.  Care is taken to avoid
 * heap-allocation in all calls, making performance suitable for
 * real-time operation.  \sa amino/math.h
 *
 * \section tf Euclidean Transforms
 *
 * Amino provides operations for transformation matrices, quaternions,
 * axis-angle representations, and some of the euler-angle
 * conventions. \sa amino/tf.h
